These are my dotfiles for setting up my environment from nothing. Take and use anything you want.

# Quickstart

To run these dotfiles quickly just source the `run.sh` file.

# Environments

These dotfiles detect which environment they are in and run the appropriate commands.  The environments tested are:

* Manjaro Gnome 17.11.1

# Colors

The colors I use for my various terminal environments are found in the Material Visual Studio Code Theme.  The hex and RGB values are, as I can tell:

* BLACK: hex: `#212121`, rgb: `(33, 33, 33)` (this is the background color in terminal)
* GREY: hex: `#656565`, rgb: `(101, 101, 101)`
* RED: hex: `#FF5370`, rgb: `(255, 83, 112)`
* GREEN: hex: `#C3E88D`, rgb: `(195, 232, 141)`
* ORANGE: hex: `#FFCB6B`, rgb: `(255, 203, 107)`
* BLUE: hex: `#82AAFF`, rgb: `(130, 170, 255)`
* PURPLE: hex: `#C792EA`, rgb: `(199, 146, 234)`
* LIGHT BLUE: hex: `#89DDFF`, rgb: `(137, 221, 255)`
