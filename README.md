These are my dotfiles for setting up my environment from nothing. Take and use anything you want.

# Quickstart

To run these dotfiles quickly just execute the `init.sh` file.

# Environments

These dotfiles detect which environment they are in and run the appropriate commands.  The environments tested are:

* macOS Mojave
* Manjaro Gnome 18.0.4
* Ubuntu 18.04

# Colors

The colors I use for my various terminal environments are found in the Material Vim Theme.  The hex and RGB values are:

* BLUE: hex `#82aaff`, rgb `(130,170,255)`
* PALE_BLUE: hex `#89ddff`, rgb `(137,221,255)`
